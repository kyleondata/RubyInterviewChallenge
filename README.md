# Ruby Interview Challenge

Your challenge, if you choose to accept it, is to build a Ruby CLI 
application that interfaces with the RottenTomatoes.com APIs. 

API documentation can be found at http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/docs

Your goals are to:

* accept user input that represents a movie title
* construct an HTTP request to the API to get information about the provided movie title
* design a class or classes that model the returned data
* marshall the JSON to the class(es) you designed
* output the movie title, MPAA raiting, year, and raiting information in a presentable format
* submit a PR to this repo with your commits

You have 3-5 days to complete this.  

Good luck!
