# Ruby Interview Challenge

Your challenge, if you choose to accept it, is to build a Ruby CLI 
application that interfaces with the Twitter APIs. 

API documentation can be found at https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/reference/get/statuses/sample

Your goals are to:

* construct an HTTP request to the API to get a random sample of tweets
* design a class or classes that model the returned data (DO NOT USE A PRE-BUILT GEM)
* marshall the JSON to the class(es) you designed
* output the username, datetime, and tweet
* submit a link to your solution committed and pushed to github.com

You have 3-5 days to complete this.  

Good luck!
